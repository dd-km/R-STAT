# R-STAT
R-STAT is a web application for statistical-graphic data analysis. 
R-STAT was developed using the R free software environment for statistical computing and graphics and the R packages Shiny and bs4Dash for creating interactive web applications. 
It is hosted on shinyapps.io, a self-service web-hosting platform for Shiny applications managed by RStudio.
Data for statistical-graphical analysis should be prepared so that:
- first column of the data table contains unique identifiers of the entity
- other columns contain the entity data in variables
- modality labels of qualitative variables must not be numbers.
Data files can be created in:
- Comma Separated Values (.csv) format,
- Microsoft Excel Worksheet (.xlsx) format,
- LibreOffice Open Document Spreadsheet (.ods) format,
- SPSS Statistics Data Document (.sav) format.
